Outlayman is an online payment system. We built it from the ground-up for 'closed communities', such as sports clubs, so they can have a payment system for internal use based on NFC identifiers. Combined with our POS called Bacchus it provides a complete system for managing payments and inventory.

**The system is currently in closed beta**.

If you're a member of a community participating in the closed beta, head over to the [Wallet website][0] or [download the Android app][1] to start using the system for payments in your community.

_Note:_ although anybody will be able to create an account on these applications, they will provide no benefit to those not participating in the beta.
