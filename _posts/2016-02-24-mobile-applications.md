Although the [Wallet website][0] provides most features for managing your wallets, it cannot provide all possible features due to its online nature. The most obvious example of this is the ability to link NFC identifiers to wallets.

The full feature set is available in an Android application for devices with NFC hardware. This application is **not** currently available from the [Play Store][1], but can be downloaded [**here**][2]. As it has not been published to the [Play Store][1], installation requires permission to install from _Unknown Sources_. This can option can be enabled from the _Security_ menu in the _Settings_ of most Android devices.

Due to technical limitations, an iOS version of the application is not currently under development. The [Wallet website][0] should operate properly on most mobile devices.
